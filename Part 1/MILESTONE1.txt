Questions:


For the explanations, generally a sentence or two should be enough. 
Type your answers directly in this file.



0.  Compile the program (using make).  What puzzle does it solve?

 - Wolf-Goat-Cabbage
1.  Edit solve.cpp to solve the MazeRunner problem, and set the code
 to declare activeStates as ArrayStack or LinkedListStack.  (You should 
only comment out one line and uncomment one line to do that.) 
Do you see why it's called depth-first search (DFS)? 
(If not, you can increase the delay in the usleep call to slow down 
the animation.) 
How many steps long was the solution it found? 
Does it make a difference whether you use ArrayStack or LinkedListStack?
- 59 (ArrayStack), 59 (LinkedListStack)
- 59 steps total, does not make a difference for both 
2.  Edit solve.cpp to solve the empty Sudoku board. 
What solution do you get?
-  9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
   6 5 4 3 2 1 9 8 7
   3 2 1 9 8 7 6 5 4
   8 9 6 7 4 5 2 1 3
   7 4 5 2 1 3 8 9 6
   2 1 3 8 9 6 7 4 5
   5 7 9 4 6 8 1 3 2
   4 6 8 1 3 2 5 7 9
   1 3 2 5 7 9 4 6 8
3.  Next, edit solve.cpp to switch to peg solitaire game (the class
 is called Marble).  Run it to completion with the usleep delay set to 10000. 
How long does that take on your computer?  Now, comment out the
usleep command as well as the two lines before it.  Now how long does it 
take to solve?  (This is why we'll comment these out when we solve
 harder puzzles.)

 
- with usleep delay = 10000 : real	0m10.928s
			      user	0m0.177s
			      sys	0m0.012s
- without usleep : real	0m0.191s
		   user	0m0.153s
		   sys	0m0.001s
4.  Edit solve.cpp to switch to the 3x3 slider puzzle.  Make sure 
the usleep and print statements in solvePuzzle are still commented out.
Try solving the 3x3 slider puzzle.  What happens? Why?
- it takes forever to solve
- reason : it's trying to solve using every step possible (and it just continually searches for a solution until it finds one)
